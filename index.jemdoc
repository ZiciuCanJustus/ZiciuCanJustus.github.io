== Pursuit
===  Analysis & Synthesize the Systems
As **an enthusiast in operations research and optimal control** who has transitioned away from chemical engineering, I still carry forward the analytical mindset and optimization strategies that were fundamental in my chemical engineering background. Now, I am keen on applying this analytical philosophy to the field of machine learning, with a specific focus on Bayesian methods. Although my professional path has diverged from chemical engineering, the core principles of systematic analysis and optimization continue to inform my approach.

My research aim is to delve into how the systematic and analytical thinking cultivated in chemical engineering can be effectively transferred and applied to machine learning. By employing Bayesian methods, I intend to introduce a level of depth and rigor in analysis that parallels the complexities and challenges faced in chemical engineering.

== Funding I Joined
=== Industrial Waste Heat Driven Waste Water Recovery
. Background: Industrial process has been greatly confronted with inevitable waste heat and waste water. To this extend, how to handle these waste water throughout these waste heat from the perspective of process synthesis with the consideration of the waste water temperature uncertainty is an interesting problem.
. Contribution: We model the waste heat-driven organic Rankine cycle process and reverse osmosis-based waste water processing plant rigorously in GAMS platform. On this basis, we test the integrated system stability by a linear programming model relaxed from an mix-integer non linear programming problem.
. Results: Approved, With the help of the proposed model, the unit product cost of our designed system is lower than those of the conventional reverse osmosis system. We proposed 1 SCI journal paper, 1 EI journal paper, and 1 EI conference paper.

=== Multi-source Heterogeneous and Low Quality Industrial Data Modeling & Fusion Methodology (National Natural Science Foundation of China)
. Background: Industrial big data has been greatly confronted with low quality property for the existence of the measurement noise. Besides, due to the diversity of the process measurement instruments including but not limited to camera, sonar, etc, how to fuse different data source in the data-driven model to better support the downstream task is a crucial problem.
. Contribution: I wrote the full part "Project Basis and Research Content" (core part) of the foundation application form.
. Results: Approved, A 1, 040 k-valued natural science foundation was approved.
