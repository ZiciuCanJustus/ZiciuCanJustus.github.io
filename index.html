<h2>Projects</h2>
<p>
</p>
<h3>Multi-source Heterogeneous and Low Quality Industrial Data Modeling &amp; Fusion Methodology (National Natural Science Funding)</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>Background: Industrial big data has been greatly confronted with low quality property for the existence of the measurement noise. Besides, it should be pointed out that the industrial data has multi-modal property for the diversity of process measurement instrumental. How to model industrial big data based on such process data is an important issue.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Contribution: I wrote the full part &ldquo;Project Basis and Research Content&rdquo; (core part).
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Results: An NSFC with 1, 040 k was approved for approval.



</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>The Synthesis of Machine Learning Systems from the Perspective of Cybernetics</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>Background: We found that existing Variational Inference algorithm can be reformulated into a stochastic optimal control problem thanks to the Celebrated Girsanov theorem. As such, how to analyze the inference model from the perspective of cybernetics is an interesting topic.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Contribution: We simplify the optimal control problem with respect to the variational inference problem, and derive a novel expectation derivation method which does not discreteinize the time domain. To this extend formulate a novel algorithm named adjoint Expectation Maximization, which solve the continuous-time latent variable model efficiently under large dataset.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Results: We improved the conventional latent variable model under regression task 50 %, and proposed 2 IEEE Transactions (Under Review).
